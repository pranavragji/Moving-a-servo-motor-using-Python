# Moving-a-servo-motor-using-Python

In this project we show how to move a servo motor. 

The servo motor works on an electrical pulse of variable with (PWM).

It turns 90 degrees left or right, or 180 degrees. 

You have to just connect the servo to (if you are using a Raspberry Pi) the GPIO ports. And with the pin number give the frequency you want to send to the servo.
